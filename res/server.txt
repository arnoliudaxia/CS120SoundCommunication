Betsy Bakker-Nort (1874â€“1946)
was a Dutch feminist lawyer,
and politician who served as
a member of the House of
Representatives for the Free-thinking
Democratic League (VDB) from 1922 to
1942. Born in Groningen, she became
involved with the
feminist movement in 1894.
At age 34, Bakker-Nort started
studying law
, realising that the fight
for women's rights required
 a thorough understanding of the law.
In the 1922 general election,
the first in which women
were allowed to vote
, she was elected to parliament
and became the VDB's first
female representative.
She was re-elected four times
and was an advocate
for more women's rights with
respect to marriage
and labour law. She took a
leading role in preparations
for a 1930 League of Nations
conference.

invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940
