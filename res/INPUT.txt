Many of those killed
 and injured
in a major earthquake
 on the Indonesian island
  of Java were children who
   were at school when it hit,
rescuers say.
Aprizal Mulyadi, 14
, said he was trapped after
 "the room collapsed and my legs
  were buried under the rubble".
He said he was pulled
 to safety by his friend Zulfikar,
  who then later died after
   himself becoming trapped.
Search teams are scrambling
 to find survivors after m
 ore than 100 people died and
 thousands were left homeless.
The 5.6 magnitude quake struck
 a mountainous region on Monday,
  causing landslides that buried
 entire villages near the West
 Java town of Cianjur.
Victims were crushed or
trapped after walls and roofs
 caved in. "It all happened so fast,"
 Aprizal told AFP news agency.

Search and Rescue Agency also confirm
