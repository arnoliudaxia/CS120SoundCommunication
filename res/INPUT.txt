The first step to build a gateway is
 to manipulate the TCP/IP traffic.
 Although different operating
systems handle network traffic differently,
they provide a similar interface to send/
receive TCP/IP
packets: the Network Socket. Refer to the
textbook for more information about socket
programming
in C/C++. You can also use Python wrapper
for socket API. If you are using Java, be
noted that
native Java socket API lacks the ability to
manipulate raw IP packets and thus you might
need to
either find third party Java packages for
low level socket or integrate Java with
other language to
finish Part3.The first step to build a
