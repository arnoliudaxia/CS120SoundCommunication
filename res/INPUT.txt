The goal of this project is to build a
gateway for the Athernet. In this way,
Athernet devices are able
to connect to the Internet. A network
gateway may contain multiple network
functions, including
DHCP server, routing, switching and so on.
This project focuses on the aspect of
interconnecting
different protocols, i.e., how to translate
Athernet traffic to run on existing Internet
infrastructure,
and vice versa. After finishing this project,
the TCP/IP traffic should be able to
run over the Athernet
network that you have built in Project2.
The first step to build a gateway is to
 manipulate the TCP/IP traffic. Although
 different operating
systems handle network traffic differently,
they provide a similar interface to
 send/receive TCP/IP
packets: the Network Socket. Refer to the
textbook for more information about socket
in C/C++. You can also use Python wrapper for
socket API. If you are using Java, be noted that
native Java socket API lacks the ability to
manipulate raw IP packets and thus you might
either find third party Java packages for low
level socket or integrate Java with other
