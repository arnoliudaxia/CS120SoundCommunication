My hobby is listening to music. When I was
a child I enjoy listening to music especially
the cartoon music, I often lose myself in it.
When I am in trouble, music can make me calm down.
When I am very tired , it can make me comfortabl
e . When I am angry with something , it aslo can
make me happy again.Do you like listening to
music? If not, I hope you can have a try, you w
ill find it beneficial
Before I was going to senior school, my father
had never said a word to show his love to me,
so that I thought he did not love me very muchand
sometimes I was upset about it. However, when I
left home for senior school, he called me frequen
tly and just asked me some simple questions like:
how’s your study and life? When do you come home? or
